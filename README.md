# dijkstra_graph

dijkstra_graph is a Ruby library implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

It uses a Fibonnaci heap for amortized O(1) updates of vertex distances, and an adjacency list for edges for O(1) look-up of the neighbours list for the current vertex.

This library is currently under development.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
